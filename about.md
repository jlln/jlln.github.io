**Summary:**

I have a background in experimental research and data analysis in the biomedical field. I have experience in extracting insights from complicated data and in communicating findings via written, graphical, and verbal means. I am interested in applying these skills to a diverse range of problems.

**Key Skills:**

**Data Analysis and Modelling: **hypothesis testing, linear models, machine learning, propensity modelling, recommendation systems.

**SQL: **SQLite, spark-sql

**Python: **Pandas, NumPy,Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib.

**Scala: **sbt, ScalaTest,  ScalaCheck, Apache Spark, IntelliJ IDE.

**R: **ggplot2, plyr, lme4.

**Project Experience:**

**	****Kaggle Animal Rescue Competition.**

I competed in the Kaggle animal shelter competition, the goal of which was to build a predictive model that could be used to improve outcomes for animals in a shelter. I conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset before building a model that placed in the top 3% of the leaderboard. This project can be viewed at [jlln.github.io](http://jlln.github.io).

**Automated Quantitative Analysis of Microscopy Images.**

This project addressed the challenge of identifying and analyzing objects in three-dimensional microscopy images, with the goal of providing quantitative data for use in addressing biological research questions. A software tool was written in Scala using the ImageJ Java API. Results were analyzed in R and visualised using ggplot2. The code for this project can be found at [https://github.com/jlln/Zisa](https://github.com/jlln/Zisa)

**Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System**

In this learning exercise I used Apache Spark to create a recommendation system using data from the LastFM music service. This project involved ingesting and cleaning data, before building and tuning an implicit feedback latent factor model. This project can be viewed at [jlln.github.io](http://jlln.github.io).

**Employment History:**

* September 2015 - December 2015: Employed as a postdoctoral research associate in the structural biology laboratory of Charlie Bond at the University of Western Australia. Responsibilities included the production, purification, and crystallization of synthetic RNA binding proteins, and assisting in the management and supervision of the laboratory.

**Education:**

* 2009 - 2014: PhD studies at the University of Western Australia and the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research. Thesis entitled "A role for hnRNPUL2 in linking the management of DNA topology with the DNA damage response" was accepted in July 2015.

* 2008: Honours in Biochemistry at the University of Western Australia (First class honours achieved).

* 2005 - 2007: BSc. (Molecular Biology) at the University of Western Australia.
